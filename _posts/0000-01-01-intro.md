Notes:

Today I'm going to be talking about writing Python extensions with Rust. This talk came about
because I wanted to write a backend for dateutil in Rust and there were a bunch of different options
and I didn't know which ones to choose and how they worked.

One caveat I'd like to start with is that there are a lot of very code-heavy slides here, and a
lot of them are written in Rust - those are mainly there for reference later, so don't feel compelled
to try to understand them or even to figure out if they are "right" or "good in any way", just let
them wash over you and enjoy the pretty syntax highlighting.
